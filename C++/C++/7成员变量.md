# Fields, parameters, local variables

fields 成员变量

- All three kinds of variable are able to store a value that is appropraite to their defined type.
- Fields are defined outside constructors and methods
- Fields are used to store data that persists throughout the life of an object. As such, they maitain the current state of an object. They have a lifetime that lasts as long as their object lasts.
- Fields have class scope: their accessibility extends throughout the whole class, and so they can be used within any of the constructors or methods of the class in which they are defined.



成员变量不在类里面， 它在类的每个对象里面。

1. If you feel the problem is not that easy to understand, the good solution is to redo it again ;)
2. Also you need to understand the process, but also you need to know the whole process.
3. If the result is not right, debug it 
4. I find that someone is watching me, and that means danger. So how to defend the attack? Just watch him, but I am not curious about the person, so what I need to do is to keep silent and keep straight and keep brave.

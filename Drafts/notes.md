Actually, I hate him, but I do not know how to deal with the situation and how to do that kind of thing.

You should know that it is just a job. And we could just do what we should do. Cherish the time and do everything we could.

I hate him.

And hate all of them.

Hatred is a strong emotion and we should do the things we want to. And that is very important.

I know I hate him. But I know, I also have my own things to do. 

That is very important.

And I think I finally come back and have my families. And I think it is a very nice thing.

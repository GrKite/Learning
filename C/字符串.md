i.e. 
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	char str[] = " hello 0 world ";
	return 0;
}
```

We could know that the '0' is 48, and the '' is 32, and the '\0' is 0, so we could use `while(*str)` to judge the end of the str

that is, and we could know everything about it ;) we could finally do a lot of thing ;) that is really nice ;)

Be careful and we could finally know that kind of thing ;) 

What we should do is to be ourselves, and that is really nice ;)

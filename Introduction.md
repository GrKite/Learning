Hello everyone! Good afternoon! 

I am glad to be here for this interview! Firstly, let me introduce myself to you!

My name is Duoduo. I graduated from Nanjing University in 2019, majoring in Liberal Arts. 

Fortunately, I got a chance to become a developer when I graduated.  I was a junior Full-stack Perl developer at that time. It is really amazing! For Back end part, there is Perl, Linux, PostgreSQL, For front end part,  there is Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS,  and there is also Engineering Part like Cloud Platform AWS, Azure, GCP, Ali Cloud, even the Kubernetes and Docker. 

Thanks to it, I learned a lot about developing, testing, deploying, and the teamwork throughout them.

For my current job, I focus on the Oracle database and C/C++ part. Debug, solve the problems and develop the new feature for our softwares. Here, I grow into a more confident girl programmer after overcoming the difficulties. 

In my spare time, I have broad interests. I love reading, from popular novels to some mathematical books. Besides, enjoying music always bring me a lot of fun. Traveling, walking or running in the park, wondering in the museum, cooking...All of them make my life happy and colorful! Of course, learning the knowledge about Computer Science is always a important part. Keep hungry, keep foolish.

Last but not least, if I am given a chance to work in this ideal corporation, I will spare no efforts to work on it!

Thank you all!

3/3:

I think I don't need to worry too much about my brother. I think I need to figure out what happened there.

And I think I need to exercise my ability to think independently. And I think I need to do that kind of thing.

It is really nice and we could do that kind of thing.

How they think and value it?

Just the same thing, but the different responses. I think it is really cool.

Think everything equally and I think it is really important!

Know something is important to you, but the other things are not important to you , and I think it is really important!

Comparison is an very important method.

Equality and confidence are also very important.
